## 🎯 Introduction
A brief overview of your project and its purpose. Mention which problem statement are your attempting to solve. Keep it concise and engaging.

**Jarvis: An Integrated solution for Platform Engineers**

We have developed an **Integrated Platform Environment**, a **one-stop solution for platform engineers** to efficiently **manage incidents, access platform-related insights, monitor application health, and verify upstream/downstream dependencies**.  

Our approach goes beyond just implementing a **GenAI model**—we have built a **comprehensive workflow** that delivers an **end-to-end, AI-powered platform support system**.  

This solution enhances operational efficiency by providing:  
✅ **Automated incident resolution**  
✅ **Intelligent recommendations**  
✅ **Real-time system health monitoring**  

Empowering engineers with a seamless troubleshooting experience. 🚀

## 💡 Inspiration
What inspired you to create this project? Describe the problem you're solving.

Modern **platform engineering teams** face increasing challenges in managing **complex infrastructure, resolving incidents efficiently, and ensuring application stability** across distributed systems.

## Key Challenges
- **Incident Resolution Delays** – Engineers spend significant time manually diagnosing issues.
- **Lack of Centralized Support** – Multiple tools and dashboards lead to inefficiencies.
- **Limited AI-driven Automation** – Existing solutions lack **GenAI-powered** insights for proactive support.

## Our Inspiration
We aimed to build an **Integrated Platform Environment**, an **AI-driven, one-stop solution** for platform engineers. By combining **GenAI capabilities with a structured workflow**, we empower engineers to:

✅ **Quickly resolve incidents** with AI-powered recommendations.  
✅ **Gain real-time visibility** into application health, dependencies, and platform insights.  
✅ **Automate platform support** for faster and more efficient troubleshooting.  

This solution streamlines platform management, reduces downtime, and **enhances operational efficiency** like never before. 🚀

## ⚙️ What It Does

## 🚀 AI-Powered Incident Resolution
- Uses **GenAI** to analyze and provide recommended solutions for incidents.  
- Reduces **mean time to resolution (MTTR)** by offering **automated troubleshooting steps**.  
- Provides contextual insights based on past incidents and historical data.  

## 📊 Real-Time Application Health Monitoring
- Displays the **health status of all applications** engineers have access to.  
- Identifies **upstream and downstream dependencies** to diagnose potential cascading failures.  
- Centralized dashboard for **quick visibility into system performance**.  

## 🔍 Integrated Query Assistance for Platform Support
- Engineers can ask **platform-related queries**, and the **GenAI model** provides intelligent responses.  
- Fetches relevant documentation, logs, and best practices automatically.  
- Eliminates the need for manual searches across different tools.  

## 🔄 Automated Workflow for Incident Management
- A **structured incident lifecycle** from **detection → analysis → resolution → validation**.  
- **Progress tracking** via a **stepper UI** to indicate incident resolution stages.  
- Engineers can approve or escalate incidents within the workflow.  

## 📡 Upstream & Downstream Dependency Verification
- Automatically maps **dependencies between applications**.  
- Helps engineers identify whether an **issue originates from an upstream failure**.  
- Reduces **time spent in root cause analysis (RCA)** by providing dependency impact insights.  

## 🔧 Customizable Incident Dashboard
- Engineers can **filter incidents based on severity, status, application, and date**.  
- Provides a **graphical view of incident trends over time**.  
- Ensures **quick identification of recurring platform issues**.  

## 🛠️ End-to-End Workflow for Platform Engineers
- A **single integrated platform** combining AI, monitoring, and support tools.  
- Engineers can manage everything **without switching between multiple dashboards**.  
- **Seamless automation + human-in-the-loop approach** ensures reliability.
